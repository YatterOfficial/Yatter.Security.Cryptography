# Yatter.Security.Cryptography

Using ONLY .NET Code from System.Security.Cryptography to both encrypt and decrypt - using RSA Public and Private key encryption - we illustrate how to use this library in our [YatterCryptographyDemo](https://github.com/YatterOfficial/YatterCryptographyDemo) repo.

You can either clone the code or accept it as a tutorial.

- We have made this project open-source under the MIT Licence so that developers who are creating third-party content for our soon to be released y@R app, have a common pattern of encrypting data that they intend pushing to our back-end.
